# This file will no longer define Django ORM models.
# Instead, it can serve as a place for conceptual data structures (e.g., Pydantic models or plain Python classes)
# or be left largely empty if structures are defined implicitly in serializers/views.

# For reference, the conceptual structure of a 'Note' document in MongoDB might be:
# {
#   "_id": ObjectId(),
#   "title": "string",
#   "using_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" or datetime object, # Decide on a consistent format
#   "author_id": ObjectId(), # Reference to the user document's _id
#   "amount": float or Decimal128, # Be mindful of precision
#   "created_at": datetime, # Optional: timestamp for creation
#   "updated_at": datetime  # Optional: timestamp for last update
# }

# User documents might look like:
# {
#   "_id": ObjectId(),
#   "username": "string",
#   "email": "string",
#   "hashed_password": "string",
#   "created_at": datetime
# }

# For now, we will leave this file with these comments.
# Actual enforcement of structure will happen in serializers and view logic.

pass # Python file cannot be completely empty if it's imported.
