# Important Note on Your Build Output for Render

Hi there! Just a quick reminder regarding your frontend build process and how it relates to the SPA rewrite rules we've configured on Render.

1.  **Production Assets:** The command `vite build` (which you likely run via `npm run build` as configured in your `package.json` within the `frontend` directory) is responsible for bundling your React application and generating the static assets for production.

2.  **Verify `index.html`:** After this build process completes successfully, please ensure that an `index.html` file is present in your specified output directory. For a standard Vite React setup, this is typically `frontend/dist/`.

3.  **Role in SPA Redirection:** The rewrite rule we set up on Render (`/*` to `/index.html`) relies on this `frontend/dist/index.html` file. When a user accesses a client-side route like `/logout`, Render will serve this `index.html` file. Your React application will then load and React Router will take over to display the correct content based on the URL.

Ensuring `frontend/dist/index.html` is correctly generated by your build is crucial for the SPA routing to work as expected on Render.
